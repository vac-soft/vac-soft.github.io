                    </div>
                    <P>A GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) gateway is a device that allows for the connection of traditional telephone systems, such as PBX (Private Branch Exchange) systems, to a GSM mobile network. This enables companies to take advantage of the benefits of mobile communication, such as increased mobility and flexibility, while still using their existing telephone infrastructure.</p>
