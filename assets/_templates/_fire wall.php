                    <li>A firewall is a network security device, either hardware or software-based, which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules it accepts, rejects or drops that specific traffic.</li>

            <h3>How Firewall Works :</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Firewall match the network traffic against the rule set defined in its table safe or not</li>
                <br>
                <li>Once the rule is matched, associate action is applied to the network traffic</li>
                <br>
                <li>Most of the traffic which reaches firewall uses one of these three major Transport Layer protocols- TCP, UDP or ICMP</li>
                <br>
                <li> All these types have a source address and destination address</li>
                <br>
                <li>A firewall establishes a barrier between secured internal networks and outside untrusted network, such as the Internet</li>
                    <br>
