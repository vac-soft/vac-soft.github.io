                    <P>Interactive Voice Response Systems (IVR) uses pre-recorded voice prompts and menus to present information and options to callers. IVR allows users to retrieve information like order status, dispatch status, flight / bus schedules, bank balances, appointment stats, gas bookings, product details and more from any telephone. An IVR system is typically a separate server that contains Digital Signal Processing (DSP) hardware that analyzes and reproduces voice patterns. The IVR server interacts with a phone system through a dedicated connection. The way in which the IVR server is connected to the phone system depends on its capabilities and physical connections..</p>
